# ðŸ“˜ Group Task Binder - Frontend

**Group Task Binder** is a powerful and intuitive task management web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The frontend is designed to streamline productivity for both individuals and teams by offering an organized and collaborative space for task tracking. Whether you're managing personal to-dos, coordinating team projects, or organizing a group study session, Group Task Binder makes the process effortless and efficient.

### ðŸ§  What It Does:
The frontend enables users to register, log in, and interact with tasks visually and efficiently. It supports task creation, updating, deletion, and status toggling, all with a responsive and clean UI. The frontend communicates with the backend API to authenticate users, manage projects, and update tasks in real time. It also supports filtering, sorting, and grouping tasks for collaborative workflows.

### ðŸ’» Technologies & Code Used
The frontend is built entirely in **JavaScript** using the **React** framework for building dynamic user interfaces. It communicates with the backend via **Axios** and manages client-side routing with **React Router**.

#### Key Libraries & Tools:
- **React** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **Axios** (HTTP Requests)
- **React Router DOM** (Page Navigation)
- **Context API** (State Management)
- **CSS Modules / TailwindCSS / Custom Styles** (for styling)
- **JWT Decoding** (for managing auth tokens)

All components are modularized under `/src/components`, and shared application state is stored using context in `/src/context`.

- Intuitive interface built with React
- Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Real-time interaction with backend via Axios
- Clean, vibrant lavender UI for a modern experience
